📊 Company Bankruptcy Prediction Project

📝 Description
The Company Bankruptcy Prediction Project is a machine learning-based implementation designed to predict the likelihood of a company declaring bankruptcy. 
Using a dataset with financial variables and economic metrics, the project provides a binary classification solution to distinguish between healthy companies and those at risk of failure.

This project is ideal for financial analysts, investors, and managers looking for predictive insights derived from historical financial data.


🎯 Objectives

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Identify significant variables.

Assess the distribution of classes and dataset balance.

Feature Engineering:

Apply techniques to improve the quality and representation of independent variables.

Use scaling, feature selection, and missing value handling strategies.


Model Building:

Develop a predictive model for binary classification.

Compare the performance of parametric and non-parametric models.

Model Evaluation:

Use metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and GINI index.

Address class imbalance issues using techniques like SMOTE or class weighting.
